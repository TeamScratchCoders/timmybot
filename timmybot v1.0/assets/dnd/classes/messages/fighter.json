An elf behind\nher, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins\nwith arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc\nnearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.\nA dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the\nogre’s club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow\naside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings\ntwo scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre,\nlooking for a blind spot in its defenses.\nA gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with\nhis trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving\nthem around for the crowd’s delight—and his own tactical\nadvantage. His opponent’s sword flares with blue light\nan instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to\nsmite him.\nAll of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons &\nDragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal\nchampions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries,\nand bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough\nknowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well\nacquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it\ndefiantly in the face.",
